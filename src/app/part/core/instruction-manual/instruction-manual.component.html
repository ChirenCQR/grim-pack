<h2>Instruction Manual</h2>

<p>
  The only thing that Core includes new is the Instruction Manual. The instruction manual contains all of the information here but directly
  in Minecraft so that it is easy to access and all the information will be accurrate and up to date since it has access to all current recipes and build instructions.
  The instruction manual allows you to view information on everything in the Grim Pack. This includes blocks, items, entites, world gen and more.
