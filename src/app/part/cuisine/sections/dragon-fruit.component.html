  Have you ever been low and health and desperately trying to find food but seeing nothing but cactus? Well now you can eat Dragon Fruit! Cactus have a small chance of dropping Dragon Fruit when destroyed. You can eat it straight away once you collect
  it! Dragon Fruit will heal 2 hunger points and are stackable.
