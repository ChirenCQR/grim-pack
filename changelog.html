<p>
Configuration lists (magic wands, grill recipes, workbench list). Have now been updated.
They now support OreDictionary by using 'oredict:name'. They now also support metadata by appending an extra colon and number to the end. You can alsu use a '?' to indicate any meta.
<br><b>Example: 'dye:4', 'minecraft:dye:?', 'modname:item:meta'.</b><br>
The OreDictionary tags also support this. As well as supporting meta overriding for the OreDictionary.
<br><b>Example: 'oredict:dye:2' (So all dyes will meta 2) or 'oredict:dye:?' (So all dyes with any meta).</b><br>

This is especially helpful for block lists (i.e. magic wands).
So, if you want all stairs you can 'oredict:stairWood'. You may want to ignore states so that no matter how the stair is placed it will still be counted so use 'oredict:stairWood:?'.
